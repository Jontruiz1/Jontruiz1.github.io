            <p>This organization aims to help 
                computer science, IS, and IT majors/minors 
                or those interested develop useful programming techniques.
                The club meets once a week to discuss different white board 
                problems, coding experiences, and long term project goals.  
                White board problems are typically used within programming 
                interviews and are helpful to go through to prepare for the 
                workforce.  Additionally, we will talk about different coding 
                experiences we have had.  This will allow the older and more 
                experienced members to share what they have done with the 
                underclassmen.  Also, the club will focus on a few long term 
                projects to teach students about combining more than one IDE 
                as well as collaboration through Github.  Overall, this club 
                will focus on working together with fellow students to learn 
                about new and older programming techniques
                in order to be more marketable in the job market. </p>
